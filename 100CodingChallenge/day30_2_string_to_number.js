Question 89: Converting Strings to Numbers: Create a function that
takes a string representing a number (like "123") and converts it
into an actual number type.

Explain & TIP: parseInt() for whole numbers or parseFloat() for decimals
are handy for turning number-like strings into real numbers, allowing
you to perform mathematical operations on them.
