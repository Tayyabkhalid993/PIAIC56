Question 120: Use a for...of loop to iterate through an array of
your favorite movies and log each one.


Explain & TIP: The for...of loop is a modern loop introduced in ES6,
designed to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings,
Maps, NodeLists, and more, making it very readable and easy to use.
