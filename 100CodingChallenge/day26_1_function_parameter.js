/*
Question 76: Function Parameters and Return Values: Create a function that
takes two numbers as parameters, adds them together, and returns the result.
Show how you can call this function and log the result.

Explain & TIP: Functions can take inputs (parameters) and give back an output
(return value). They're like personal assistants that do a specific task for
you and report back with the results.

// Created arrow function with two parameters that returns sum of it.
let add = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
// calling function and print the result.
console.log(add(4, 2));
export {};
